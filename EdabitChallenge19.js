//Christmas Eve is almost upon us, so naturally we need to prepare some milk and cookies for Santa! Create a function that accepts a Date object and returns true if it's Christmas Eve (December 24th) and false otherwise. Keep in mind JavaScript's Date month is 0 based, meaning December is the 11th month while January is 0.

function timeForMilkAndCookies(date) {
	return date.getMonth() === 11 && date.getDate() === 24;
}
